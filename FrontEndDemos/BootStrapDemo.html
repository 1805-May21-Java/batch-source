        <p class="text-left">Let your heart be your guide. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't
            have big clouds. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. I get carried away with this brush cleaning.</p>

        <p class="text-right text-primary">We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not
            sure we really care. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. You don't want to kill all your
            dark areas they are very important. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.</p>

        <p class="text-justify text-success">There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Take your
            time. Speed will come later. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. In this world, everything can
            be happy. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>

        <p class="text-nowrap text-info">Let's have a nice tree right here. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Isn't that fantastic?
            You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. How to paint.
            That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>

        <p class="text-warning">We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Everybody needs a
            friend. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. You
            can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>

        <p class="text-danger">Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe
            he fell into the river and drowned. We need dark in order to show light. It's important to me that you're happy.
            We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Use
            what happens naturally, don't fight it.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8">It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision
                in your mind. Don't fiddle with it all day. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.
                You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Learn when to stop. Don't kill all your
                dark areas - you need them to show the light. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. You can
                work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green
                snow. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-4">Isn't that fantastic? We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Clouds are free they come and
                go as they please. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Everyone needs a
                friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Let's put some highlights on these little trees.
                The sun wouldn't forget them. You're meant to have fun in life. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs
                a friend. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. But we're not there yet, so we don't
                need to worry about it. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.
                Just beat the devil out of it. What the devil. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. God gave you
                this gift of imagination. Use it.</p>
