    <h3>About Batman</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            At the age of 18, Batman started fighting crime around the 1980s.
            He uses any means of interrogation to solve crimes that are otherwise
            out of the hands of the police. While his vigilantism has helped
            reduce the number of crimes in the area, more dangerous criminals have
            appeared to match Batman's skill, creating a greater risk innocent bystanders.
            The police also view batman as another criminal for acting above the law,
            in spite of his actions to stop crimes.

    <h3>Personal Life</h3>
    <div class="container" >
        <p>
            While working as a costumed vigilante by night, by day Batman is Billionaire Bruce Wayne.
            Unlike vigilante persona, Bruce Wayne comes off as an easy going playboy, making use of
            his extravagant wealth to entertain Gotham's rich elite. His actions as Bruce Wayne keeps
            people from suspecting he's Batman, as people assume he has no reason to be a vigilante
            because of his wealth.
