        <p>The Sun is what is known as a main sequence star; that is, a sphere composed primarily of the two gases hydrogen
            and helium such that certain conditions are met. </p>
        <p>The size of the Sun compared to the largest known stars (red giants) is not very big. However, if compared to the
            most common type of star in the universe, the red dwarf, the Sun is quite a bit larger. Thus, the Sun is not
            the biggest type of star in the universe, but it is definitely larger than most.</p>
        <p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in the solar system.</p>
