    <h1>Sloths</h1>
    <p>Let's do that again. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.</p>

<p>La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.</p>

<p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>

<p>It's cold, but it's beautiful. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.</p>

<p>Let's get wild today. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Do an almighty painting with us. What the devil. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help.</p>

<p>It's important to me that you're happy. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. There it is. Get tough with it, get strong.</p>

<p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.</p>
