        <p>Currently, there are eight known families of lizards found across North America, with 155 identified species. These squamate reptiles first appear in the fossil record during the Triassic period some 251 million to 199 million years ago. Found on all continents except Antarctica, lizards thrive in arid regions at elevations from sea level to 16,000 feet (5,000 meters). Worldwide, they range in size from the less than 3-inch-long (7 cm) gecko species to the giant Komodo dragons, Varanus komodoensis, which can grow upward to 10 feet (3 m) in length.</p>
