    <h3>About Robin</h3>
    <div id="info">
        <p>
            Robin began his life as Batman's sidekick after the tragin death of his
            family by the hands of the villain Two-Face. Trained by Batman to one day
            succeed him in taking his name, Robin employs all the combat and detective
            skills of his master. While active helping Batman fight crime, he sometimes questions
            the brutal tactics employed during the fight on crime, preferring a more merciful
            approach if possible.
