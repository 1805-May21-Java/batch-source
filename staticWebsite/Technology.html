             Batman employs a wide variaty of technology for his war on crime. For combat 
             he uses bat-themed boomerangs called Batarangs, smokes bombs, and non-lethal emplosives.
             For mobility he uses a protype-military vehicle called the Batmobile and an experimental
             aircraft called the Batwing.
             In his detective work he employs a decryption tool to get around security devices 
             and has supercomputer to analyze any and all evidence he collects.
