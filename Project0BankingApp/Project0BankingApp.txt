Create a console application that will function as a mock bank using solely Java 1.8. 
Persist your data in a text file. 
You may also write functionality to serialize your bank after every transaction but this is not a requirement.

As a user, I can:
        * create an account with a unique email or username
        * log in 
        * log out
        * deposit money
        * withdraw money
        * view balance

To note: There are no strict requirements regarding the flow of operation for your program, but keep the user in mind. 
Is your menu clear? Is user input validated? Do I have to log back in after each transaction? All important things to consider.
