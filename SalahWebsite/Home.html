        <p> Mohamed Salah Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح غالى‎  Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli]; born 15 June 1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer 
            who plays as a forward for English club Liverpool and the Egyptian national team.</p>

        <p>Salah started his senior career with hometown club El Mokawloon in the Egyptian Premier League in 2010, departing shortly thereafter to join Basel for an undisclosed fee. 
            In Switzerland, he starred as he won the league title in his debut season, winning the SAFP Golden Player Award in the process. Salah's performances then attracted Premier League side Chelsea, 
            and subsequently signed for the team for a £11 million fee in 2014. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season, and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma, 
            with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million.</p>
                
        <p>Following consistent match-winning performances in Rome to lead them to second-placed finish and a record 
            points-tally in 2017, Salah relocated back to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record 
            fee of £36.9 million. During his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a 
            complete forward, and quickly became the focal point of the team. He would go on to break the club's scoring 
            record for a debut season, as well as becoming the first player ever to win three Premier League Player of the 
            Month awards in the same season. He would further go onto be named in the 2017–18 PFA Team of the Year and as 
            the 2017–18 PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Fans' Player of the Year, Football Writers' Player of the Year 
            and Premier League Player of the Season, while also being the recipient of the Premier League Golden Boot after
             registering a record 32 goals in 36 league games.</p>
                
        <p>At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level, winning a bronze medal in the Africa U-20 Cup of 
            Nations, and participated in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2012 Summer Olympics. He was awarded the CAF 
            Most Promising African Talent of the Year in 2012.[5] Making his debut with the senior national team in 2011, he 
            helped Egypt reach the final of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, and he became the top scorer during CAF 
            qualification to help the team qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. For his performances, Salah was named CAF 
            African Footballer of the Year and the BBC African Footballer of the Year.[6][7] He was also selected in the CAF 
            Team of the Year and Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament. </p>
