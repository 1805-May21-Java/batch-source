                <p>Monotropa uniflora, also known as ghost plant (or ghost pipe), Indian pipe or corpse plant, is a herbaceous perennial 
                    plant native to temperate regions of Udmurtiya in European Russia, Asia, North America and northern South America, but with large gaps between areas.</p>
                <p>Unlike most plants, it is white and does not contain chlorophyll. Instead of generating energy from sunlight, it is parasitic, more specifically a myco-heterotroph.
                    Its hosts are certain fungi that are mycorrhizal with trees, meaning it ultimately gets its energy from photosynthetic trees. Since it is not dependent on sunlight to grow,
                     it can grow in very dark environments as in the understory of dense forest. It is often associated with beech trees.The complex relationship that allows this plant to grow also makes propagation difficult.
                    The plant is sometimes completely white but commonly has black flecks and a pale pink coloration.Rare variants may have a deep red color.
