        <h1>Lycoris Radiata</h1>
        <p>
            Lycoris Radiata, also know as the red spider lily or the equinox flower, is a plant in the amaryllis family, Amaryllidaceae.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bulbs of Lycoris radiata are very poisonous. These are mostly used in Japan, and they are used to surround rice paddies
            and houses to keep pests and mice away. That is why most of them grow close to rivers now. In Japan the red spider
            lily signals shūbun, the arrival of fall. Many Buddhists will use it to celebrate the arrival of fall with a
            ceremony at the tomb of one of their ancestors. They plant them on graves because it shows a tribute to the dead.
            People believe that since the red spider lily is mostly associated with death, one should never give a bouquet
            of these flowers. Since these scarlet flowers usually bloom near cemeteries around the autumnal equinox, they
            are described in Chinese and Japanese translations of the Lotus Sutra as ominous flowers that grow in Diyu (also
            known as Hell), or Huángquán (Simplified Chinese: 黄泉; Traditional Chinese: 黃泉), and guide the dead into the next
            reincarnation. Some legends have it that when you see someone that you may never meet again, these flowers, also
            called red spider lilies or corpse flowers, would bloom along the path. Perhaps because of these sorrowful legends,
            Japanese people often used these flowers in funerals. The popular Japanese name Higanbana (彼岸花 Higan bana) for
            Lycoris radiata literally means higan (the other or that shore of Sanzu River) flower, decorative and enjoyable,
            flower of the afterlife in gokuraku jyōdo.
