            The ancient inhabitants of what is today central and southern California used to ingest the small black seeds of datura to "commune with deities through visions".
            Across the Americas, other indigenous peoples such as the Algonquin, Navajo, Cherokee, Luiseño and the indigenous peoples of Marie-Galante also used this plant in sacred ceremonies for its hallucinogenic properties.
            In Ethiopia, some students and debtrawoch (lay priests), use D. stramonium to "open the mind" to be more receptive to learning, and creative and imaginative thinking.
            In his book, The Serpent and the Rainbow, Wade Davis identified D. stramonium, called "zombi cucumber" in Haiti, as a central ingredient of the concoction vodou priests use to create zombies.            
            The common name "datura" has its roots in India, where the plant is considered particularly sacred—believed to be a favorite of Shiva in Shaivism.
