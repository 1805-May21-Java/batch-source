Create a question game which randomly matches an associate with a question
-        Create a new java project
-        Create a collection (implementation of the collection interface of your choice) which contains a pool of associate names
-        Create a collection (implementation of the collection interface of your choice) which contains a pool of questions
-        Randomly match associates to questions, essentially “asking” them the question
-        Display associate/question match one at a time, using the scanner class to require user input to display the next consecutive associate/question match
-        If you have time, have the associate names and question content be read from an external file
