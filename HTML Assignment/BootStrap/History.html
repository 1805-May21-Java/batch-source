            class="img-fluid float-right" alt="Indiana Seal" width="200">The history of human activity in Indiana, a U.S. state in the Midwest, began with migratory tribes of Native Americans
        who inhabited Indiana as early as 8000 BC. Tribes succeeded one another in dominance for several thousand years and
        reached their peak of development during the period of Mississippian culture. The region entered recorded history
        in the 1670s when the first Europeans came to Indiana and claimed the territory for the Kingdom of France. After
        France ruled for a century (with little settlement in this area), it was defeated by Great Britain in the French
        and Indian War (Seven Years' War) and ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River. Britain held the land for
        more than twenty years, until after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, then ceded the entire trans-Allegheny
        region, including what is now Indiana, to the newly-formed United States.</p>

    <p>The U.S. government divided the trans-Allegheny region into several new territories. The largest of these was the Northwest
        Territory, which the U.S. Congress subsequently subdivided into several smaller territories. In 1800 the Indiana
        Territory became the first of these new territory established from a portion of the Northwest Territory. The Indiana
        Territory grew in population and development until it was admitted to the Union in 1816 as Indiana, the nineteenth
        state. The newly-established state government laid out on an ambitious plan to transform Indiana from a segment of
        the frontier into a developed, well-populated, and thriving state. State founders initiated an internal improvement
        program that led to the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and state-funded public schools. Despite the noble
        aims of the project, profligate spending ruined the state's credit. By 1841 the state was near bankruptcy and was
        forced to liquidate most of its public works. Acting under its new Constitution of 1851, the state government enacted
        major financial reforms, required that most public offices be filled by election rather than appointment, and greatly
        weakened the power of the governor. The ambitious developent program of Indiana's founders was realized when Indiana
        became the fourth-largest state in terms of population, as measured by the 1860 census.</p>

    <p>Indiana became politically influential and played an important role in the Union during the American Civil War. Indiana
        was the first western state to mobilize for the war, and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during
        the war. Following the Civil War, Indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in U.S.
        Presidential elections. It helped decide control of the presidency for three decades. During the Indiana Gas Boom
        of the late 19th century, industry began to develop rapidly in the state. The state's Golden Age of Literature began
        in the same time period, increasing its cultural influence. By the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong
        manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal migrants to its industries. It experienced setbacks
        during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, expansion of the auto
        industry, urban development, and two wars contributed to the state's industrial growth. During the second half of
        the 20th century, Indiana became a leader in the pharmaceutical industry due to the innovations of companies such
        as Eli Lilly.</p>
