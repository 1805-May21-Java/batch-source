        <p class="text-left text-info">In your world you can create anything you desire. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just
            have to push them out. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.
            And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening
            - you just let it happen.</p>

        <p class="text-right"> I like to beat the brush. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Let all
            these things just sort of happen. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to
            look to see it.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you
            are. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.</p>

        <p class="text-danger">Every time you practice, you learn more. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to
            move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.
            And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it.
            Go crazy. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.</p>

        <p class="text-warning">We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose
            into the world. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. We have a
            fantastic little sky! Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We'll do another happy
            little painting. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.</p>

        <p>Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to
            resist these things. Just let them happen. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make
            in school.</p>

        <p>So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. The little tiny Tim easels will let you
            down. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.</p>

        <p class="col-lg-8">Let's have a nice tree right here. You need the dark in order to show the light. La- da- da- da- dah.
            Just be happy. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ 
            ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things
            All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.</p>

        <p class="col-lg-auto">Let's get wild today. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.
            All you have to learn here is how to have fun. In this world, everything can be happy.</p>

        <p class="col-sm-8">If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. So often we avoid running water, and running
            water is a lot of fun. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to
            you. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.</p>

        <p>Let the paint work. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out
            of us. See there, told you that would be easy. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from
            your masterpieces.</p>

        <p>Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.
            Anything you want to do you can do here. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy
            and doesn't hurt anyone.</p>

        <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.
            In your world you can create anything you desire. Here's something that's fun. I really recommend you
            use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be
            working by yourself.</p>

        <p>Let's do it again then, what the heck. In painting, you have unlimited power.
            You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have
            power over is the garbage. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite
            direction. Let's build an almighty mountain. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world
            I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</p>
