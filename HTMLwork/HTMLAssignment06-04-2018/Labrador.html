    <p>Dog Breed: Labrador</p>
    <p>Meme Breed: Big Boye</p>
    <p>Best Habitat: Very Flexible with location</p>
    <p>Labradors are medium-large, with males typically weighing 65–80 lb (29–36 kg) and
        females 55–70 lb (25–32 kg). The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour,
        are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever.
        As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically "Show", "English" or "bench") and the Field
        (typically "Working" or "American")
        lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries. In general, however, Conformation
        Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly
        calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly
        less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. However, Field Labradors should still be proportional
        and fit within American Kennel Club standards. With Field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads,
        long legs, and lanky frames are not considered standard. These two types are informal and not codified or
        standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different
        breeding lines. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the West, they are common in Asia. These dogs
        are also very good with children.</p>
