    <p>Dog Breed: Siberian Husky</p>
    <p>Meme Breed: Moon-Moon</p>
    <p>Best Habitat: Colder Areas</p>
    <p>The first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago; however, people and their dogs did not settle in the
        Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 8,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both
        originating from Siberia. The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi
        Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska, in 1908 for sled-dog racing.
        In 1989, a study was made of ancient canid remains dated to the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene
        that had been uncovered by miners decades earlier around Fairbanks, Alaska. These were identified as Canis lupus
        and described as "short-faced wolves". The collection was separated into those specimens that looked more
        wolf-like (i.e. the Beringian wolf), and those that looked more dog-like and in comparison to the skulls of
        Eskimo dogs from both Greenland and Siberia thought to be their forerunners.
        In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute
        and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled
        dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland dog. In
        North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had
        contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds
        that were consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America.</p>
