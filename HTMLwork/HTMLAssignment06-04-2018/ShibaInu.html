        the Shiba Inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century.

        Western dog breeds were imported and crosses between these and native Japanese breeds became popular. From 1912
        to 1926, almost no pure Shiba remained. From around 1928, hunters and intellectuals began to show interest in
        the protection the remaining pure Shiba</p>
