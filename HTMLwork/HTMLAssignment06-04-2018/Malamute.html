        <p>Description: Thought to have originated from the Malemiut Inupiaq people of Alaskas
        Norton sound region. In North America, the Malamute and the Siberian Husky both had maintained
        their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence
        of crossing with European breeds that was consistent with this
        breed being created in post-colonial North America</p>
