    <h1>Good Afternoon</h1>
    <h2>Good Day</h2>
    <h3>Good Post</h3>
    <p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into
        the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Paint anything you want on the canvas.
        Create your own world. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative;
        these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.
        That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make
        this world as happy as I want it. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.
        You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.</p>

    <p>Don't fight it, use what happens. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.
        Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of.
        You have that power.</p>

    <p><span id="Imagination">Use what you see, don't plan it</span>. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains.
        You can do anything. Only eight colors that you need. Just make a decision and let it go.
        Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.
        Brown is such a nice color. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.
        All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.</p>

    <p>Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.
        Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. That's a crooked tree.
        We'll send him to Washington.</p>

    <p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.
        Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p>

    <p>Let's make a nice big leafy tree. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red,
        and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
        framework first.</p>
