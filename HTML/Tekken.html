        <h1>Descripton</h1>
        <p>Tekken 7 (鉄拳7) is a fighting game developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game is the ninth installment in the Tekken series, and the first to make use of the Unreal Engine. Tekken 7 had a limited arcade release in Japan in March 2015. An updated arcade version, Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, was released in Japan in July 2016, and features expanded content including new stages, costumes, items and characters.[1] The same version was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2017.[2]
        Set shortly after the events of Tekken 6, the plot focuses on the events leading up to the final battle between martial artist Heihachi Mishima and his son, Kazuya. Tekken 7 introduces elements for the fighting system such as the Rage and the Power Crush to increase the characters' powers.
        Tekken 7 was a critical and commercial success, selling three million copies worldwide by the end of 2017.</p>
