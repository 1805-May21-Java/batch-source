                <p>The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. But you are dressed as one… The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
                <p>Well, how'd you become king, then? Well, she turned me into a newt. Be quiet! On second thoughts, let's not go there. <strong> It is a silly place.</strong> <em> Shut up!</em> Where'd you get the coconuts?</p>
                <h2>Shut up!</h2>
                <p>It's only a model. But you are dressed as one… I dunno. Must be a king. She looks like one. Shut up! Will you shut up?!</p>

                <h3>Burn her anyway!</h3>
                <p>Did you dress her up like this? I have to push the pram a lot. What a strange person. What do you mean? Why do you think that she is a witch?</p>

                <p>I'm not a witch. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
                <p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Why do you think that she is a witch? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, she turned me into a newt. Well, what do you want?</p>
                <p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. He hasn't got shit all over him. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. You don't vote for kings. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
                <p>Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!</p>
                <p>Burn her! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Why?</p>
                <p>You don't vote for kings. What do you mean? Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</p>
                <p>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! What a strange person.</p>
                <p>And the hat. She's a witch! Who's that then? Look, my liege! Shut up! Will you shut up?! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
                <p>Look, my liege! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Burn her anyway! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. What a strange person.</p>
                <p>Shut up! Why do you think that she is a witch? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Bloody Peasant! Burn her!</p>
                <p>Where'd you get the coconuts? It's only a model. Did you dress her up like this? Did you dress her up like this? How do you know she is a witch?</p>
