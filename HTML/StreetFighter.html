        <h1>Descripton</h1>
        <p>Street Fighter V[a] is a fighting video game developed by Capcom and Dimps. The game was released in February 2016 for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows; a Linux version was announced for release in Spring 2016, but has not emerged. The game features cross-platform play between the PlayStation 4 and Windows versions.
            Similar to the previous games in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter V features a side-scrolling fighting gameplay system. The game also introduces the "V-Gauge", which builds as the player receives attacks and adds three new skills. The game features 16 characters at launch, with four of them being new to the series. A story mode and additional characters were added through updates and downloadable content.
            According to Capcom, the game was a PlayStation 4 console exclusive as both Sony and Capcom had "the same vision for the growth potential in the fighting game space". The game was powered by Unreal Engine 4, and had a beta test prior to its launch. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's graphics and gameplay, but was criticized for its lack of content and characters, as well as its technical issues such as broken servers at launch and software bugs. Capcom was expecting the game to sell at least 2 million copies by the end of their fiscal year 2016. It missed the sales target, selling only 1.4 million copies as of March 31, 2016; though its accumulated lifetime sales got close to 2.5 million.</p>
