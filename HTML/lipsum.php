                <h2>Dog Ross Once Said</h2>
                <p>Learn when to stop. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>

                <p>This piece of canvas is your world. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Fluff that up. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>

                <p>Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Isn't that fantastic?</p>

                <p>Don't fiddle with it all day. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.</p>

                <p>Let's make a nice big leafy tree. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. In this world, everything can be happy.</p>

                <p>Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. It's important to me that you're happy. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You are only limited by your imagination.</p>

                <p>You gotta think like a tree. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Let's do it again then, what the heck.</p>
