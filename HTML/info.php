                <p>They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
                <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. <strong> They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!</strong> <em> I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.</em> *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>

                <p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
