                The "look at this bird" meme originated from <span id="fb">Facebook</span>, when hundreds of 
                people posted on the wall of <span id="fb">Facebook</span> founder Mack Zuckerberg, all with 
                the previously shown picture of a bird appearing to have caught its head 
                on fire, and the accompanying comment "look at this f***ing bird".
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, Mark Zuckerberg disabled the ability to post that comment. 
                For a certain period of time, users were not able to post a comment saying 
                "look at this f***ing bird". It would fail with an error message saying 
                "Failed to post comment" but succeed with any slight misspelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The comment has since been enabled, and <span id="fb">Facebook</span> continues to profit off 
                selling privacy to advertisers, and the world keeps spinning, but at least 
                we can look at this duck and appreciate that it legitimately made the 
                largest social media platform ban a phrase from its comment section for a 
                couple years.
