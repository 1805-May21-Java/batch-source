		You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Every time you practice, you learn more. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.
