        <p class="text-right text-primary">Anything you want to do you can do here. A little happy sunlight shining through there. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>

Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</p>

            <p class="col-md-4">Let your imagination be your guide. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Every time you practice, you learn more. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Use what you see, don't plan it.</p>
