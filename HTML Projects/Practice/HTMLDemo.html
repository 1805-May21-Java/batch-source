        <p class="coolText">Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Anything you want to do you can do here. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.</p>

        <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.</p>

        <p class="coolText">Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. And just raise cain. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.</p>

        <p id="imagination">This piece of canvas is your world. Everybody needs a friend. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</p>
