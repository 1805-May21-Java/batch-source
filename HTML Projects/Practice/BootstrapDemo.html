        <p class="text-left">Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

        <p class="text-right text-primary">If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. This is truly an almighty mountain. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.</p>

        <p class="text-justify text-success">If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. You can do anything your heart can imagine. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Be brave. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>

        <p class="text-nowrap text-info">Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Let your imagination be your guide. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>

        <p class="text-warning">Just make a decision and let it go. With practice comes confidence. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>

        <p class="text-danger">Let's have a little bit of fun today. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</p>

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-4">You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. It is a lot of fun. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.</p>
