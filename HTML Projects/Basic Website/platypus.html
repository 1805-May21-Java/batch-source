        <p>There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>

        <p>Don't fiddle with it all day. In this world, everything can be happy. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Just use the old one inch brush. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Imagination is the key to painting. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.</p>
        
        <p>Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Take your time. Speed will come later. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.</p>

        <p>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. This is the fun part</p>
        
        <p>Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Let's get wild today. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.</p>
        
        <p>Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. At home you have unlimited time. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Son of a gun. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.</p>
