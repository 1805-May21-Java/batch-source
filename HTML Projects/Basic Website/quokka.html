        <p>Happy painting, God bless. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.</p>
    
        <p>We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>
    
        <p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We have a fantastic little sky! A happy cloud.</p>
    
        <p>Let your imagination be your guide. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Let's build an almighty mountain. Poor old tree. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.</p>
    
        <p>There are no limits in this world. This is the way you take out your flustrations. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.</p>
    
        <p>Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.</p>
    
        <p>You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.</p>
