        <h3>are evil.</h3>
        
        <p>Various facts about magpies and swooping season.</p>

        <p>This is unplanned it really just happens. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Fluff that up.</p>

        <p>You can create anything that makes you happy. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.</p>

        <p>Let all these things just sort of happen. A happy cloud. Let your imagination be your guide. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.</p>

        <img src="img/magpie_news.jpg" class="rounded float-left border shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"/>

        <p>That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. You have to make these big decisions. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. What the devil.</p>

        <p>Put it in, leave it alone. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.</p>

        <p>These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p>

        <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Let the paint work.</p>

        <p>This. Bird.</p>
